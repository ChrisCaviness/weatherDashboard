Christopher Caviness - Weather Dashboard Homework

1. Created the HTML to be targeted and changed by the JavaScript using parsed JSON information collected by the API.

2. Called to the weather API, displaying the data in the console.

Notes:
Clearly unfinished project, but I could not figure out how to parse the data pulled from the API. Nothing I tried worked. The set up is there, the data is there, but I was unable to get the data to display. Out of time for this submission.
